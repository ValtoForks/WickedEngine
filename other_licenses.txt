No Other License. No rights or licenses are granted by NVIDIA under this License, expressly or by implication, with respect to any proprietary information or patent, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property right owned or controlled by NVIDIA, except as expressly provided in this License.
Term:  This License is effective until terminated.  NVIDIA may terminate this Agreement (and with it, all of Developer’s right to the Materials) immediately upon written notice (which may include email) to Developer, with or without cause.

Support:  NVIDIA has no obligation to support or to continue providing or updating any of the Materials.

No Warranty:  THE SOFTWARE AND ANY OTHER MATERIALS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA TO DEVELOPER HEREUNDER ARE PROVIDED "AS IS."
